Signage and logos designed by Lian Fumerton-Liu, June 2018. 

The files for the signs are formatted for 22 x 28 inch custom size, and to meet SBPrinters's specs: "All files must be submitted as a PDF, saved in CMYK mode (as opposed to RGB etc.) with the file dimensions set to the final printed size, at 300 dpi"

Also included are lowres versions of the files.
